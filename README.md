# CPU Speed
Set cpu speed easily for rooted android phones.

## Motivation
### Surface Pro
I installed Android x86 on my Surface Pro and it had poor battery life. That's why I thought maybe lower the cpu speed would increase its battery life. Therefore, I downloaded [Kernel Adiutor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grarak.kerneladiutor&hl=en_US) but somehow it couldn't adjust the frequency so I had to write one for myself...

### GPD XD
I installed legacy rom and needed to adjust its clock speed when I am playing emulators for better performance.

### OnePlus 5
OnePlus is also really fast but have you ever wondered why? It is simple. Always run at max speed but after installing Lineage OS, I rooted my device. Now, I can control its speed to get longer battery life (hopeful).
