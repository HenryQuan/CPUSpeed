# CPU Speed
Set CPU Speed easily for rooted android phones (may not work on all).

Kernel Adiutor disappeared when I last checked and I don't know what happened. Now, my OnePlus 5 is rooted again so I could work on this app again.

## Devices
### Surface Pro
I installed Android x86 on my Surface Pro and it had poor battery life. That's why I thought maybe lower the cpu speed would increase its battery life. Therefore, I downloaded [Kernel Adiutor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grarak.kerneladiutor&hl=en_US) but somehow it couldn't adjust the frequency so I had to write one myself...

### GPD XD
I installed legacy rom and needed to adjust its clock speed when I am playing emulators for better performance. There is one app charging you $3 so I had to write one myself...

### OnePlus 5
OnePlus is also really fast but have you ever wondered why? It is simple. Always run at max speed but after installing Lineage OS, I rooted my device. Now, I can control its speed to get longer battery life (maybe).

# Extra
This was my first ever native Android app written in Java. I was using React Native quite a lot and learning Flutter back then. What's the future of native apps? What's different between a web app and a native app? Time to slow down. What makes iOS iOS and what makes Android Android? What is a mobile app?

This was written in May 2019. 

Now, it is Oct 2020 and I think I know the answer now and I have changed back to native again but I will still keep an eye on React Native and Flutter.
