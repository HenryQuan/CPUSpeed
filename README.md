# CPU Speed
Set cpu frequency easily for rooted android phones.

## Motivation
I installed Android x86 on my Surface Pro and it had poor battery life. That's why I thought maybe lower the cpu speed would increase its battery life. Therefore, I downloaded [Kernel Adiutor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grarak.kerneladiutor&hl=en_US) but somehow it couldn't adjust the frequency so I had to write one for myself...
