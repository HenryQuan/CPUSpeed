# CPU Speed (Deprecated)
Set CPU Speed easily for rooted android phones (may not work on all).

**I changed to Samsung A70 and flushed official rom to OnePLus 5 so I don't have any rooted devices anymore. Therefore, this app is no longer under development.** Back then, I saw an app that costed 1 dollar just to update your cpu speed. That's why I wrote this app because it should be free.

## Motivation
This is my first ever native Android app written in Java. I am using React Native a lot and learning Flutter recently. Is native development gonna die? I don't think so. React Native and Flutter are sure great and faster. However, you need to know native. Otherwise, what's different from a website (web app) if you only want to cross multiple platforms? I should do more and know more about native development as well. Time to slow down. What makes IOS IOS and what makes Android Android? What is an app?

### Surface Pro
I installed Android x86 on my Surface Pro and it had poor battery life. That's why I thought maybe lower the cpu speed would increase its battery life. Therefore, I downloaded [Kernel Adiutor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grarak.kerneladiutor&hl=en_US) but somehow it couldn't adjust the frequency so I had to write one for myself...

### GPD XD
I installed legacy rom and needed to adjust its clock speed when I am playing emulators for better performance. There is one app charging you $3...

### OnePlus 5
OnePlus is also really fast but have you ever wondered why? It is simple. Always run at max speed but after installing Lineage OS, I rooted my device. Now, I can control its speed to get longer battery life (hopeful). For me, battery life is the most important thing so I am changing to another phone soon...
